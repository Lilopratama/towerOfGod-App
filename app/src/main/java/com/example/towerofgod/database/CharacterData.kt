            "Twenty-Fifth Baam (스물다섯번째 밤, Seumooldahseotbeonjjae Bah, Twenty-Fifth Night or simply Baam for short, is an Irregular and the main protagonist of Tower of God. Baam entered the Tower in search of his best and only friend, Rachel, another Irregular, who wanted to climb to the top of the Tower and see the stars. Upon passing Headon's test, he is deemed worthy of climbing the Tower. Before ascending, however, Baam must pass the Testing Floors (starting at Floor 2) whose purpose is to weed out anyone that might bring harm to the Tower. Bam finds a strong team and makes some great allies in the process.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "After being presumed dead after the events on the Test Floor, Baam is forcibly recruited into the organisation FUG, and later joins a new team: Team Tangsooyook. He manages to escape from FUG's clutches, eventually reuniting with his old friends and teammates. While affiliated with FUG, he went by the name Jue Viole Grace[15] (쥬 비올레 그레이스, Jyu Biolle Geuleiseu), a moniker that still follows him to this day. The name 'Jue Viole Grace' appears to have come from his mother Arlen Grace and his father V's names. This information is relayed to Baam during the events of the Floor of Death arc by the princess-in-hiding Garam Zahard[16] and further confirmed by Po Bidau Gustang, who refers to him as Son of Arlen, and the data of Khun Eduan, who refers to him as Son of V.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Once the Battle of the Last Station's events concluded, he willingly returned to FUG to train for two years and to utilize their resources to find a way to revive the comatose Khun Aguero Agnis and track down the Zahard Army's 4th Corps Commander Kallavan for having killed his master Ha Jinsung. Later discovering that his master was still alive and being held hostage by Zahard's forces under Khun Maschenny Zahard's watch, he and his team prepared for the opening battle of FUG's war against the Zahard Empire at the Battle of The Nest on the 52nd Floor.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "During the Battle of The Nest Baam and his team were pit against high rankers in the 4th Army Corp, which included Ranker members and Branch Leaders of the Lo Po Bia Family. Baam managed to both confront and fight Kallavan to a standstill. He astounded those present with the power and abilities he possesses by exhibiting both teleportation and spell-nullifying capabilities, notably as FUG breaches the First Defensive Wall with his help and allowing their forces to advance through The Second Defensive Wall. In the Cat Tower game directed by Lo Po Bia Yasratcha, Baam eventually confronts Arie White in his prime form. The fight appears to develop a darker side to Baam's powers, and at the end of the fight he, Khun and Rak all receive specific parts of White's powers. Shortly after, Baam manages to successfully reunite with his master.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The Nest battle derails with the appearance of Lo Po Bia Traumerei, family head of the Lo Po Bia Family and one of the Great Warriors, who takes Baam hostage with the intention to marry him into his Great Family, effectively ending the Nest battle and scattering many of FUG's forces across several unknown floors. Jinsung successfully convinces Traumerei to run a marriage competition for Baam's hand instead. The competition does not resolve in an actual marriage, but instead evolves into a competition between Traumerei and Gustang for the rights to Baam's freedom and their own lives at a Guide waymarker known as the Sprout.",
